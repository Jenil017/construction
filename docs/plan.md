See `docs/progress.md` for the detailed log.
>
> **Model change (2026-06-07):** Company and Project were removed. **Site is now the top-level tenant boundary** — an owner holds many sites, each user has per-site, per-module access (read / read+write), and data is scoped to the active site (chosen via an `X-Site-Id` header / site switcher). References to "Company" / "Project" / company-wide "roles" in the phases below are superseded by the site model; treat `siteId` as the tenant key for Phase 4+.

## Phase 0: Project Setup And Documentation — ✅ Completed

## Phase 3: Company, Project, And Site Setup — ✅ Completed (2026-06-07)

Goals:

- Create company/tenant model. ✅ (company profile `GET/PATCH /company`)
- Create projects module. ✅
- Create sites module. ✅
- Assign users to projects/sites. ✅ (site-level via `site_assignments`)
- Add table-first frontend screens. ✅

Deliverables:

- Project schema ✅ (`projects`)
- Site schema ✅ (`sites` + `site_assignments`)
- Project and site APIs ✅ (+ company profile API)
- Project and site frontend screens ✅ (+ company settings screen)

Note: `site`/`own` scope **enforcement** uses the `site_assignments` data delivered here but is wired into the operational modules from Phase 4 onward (nothing to row-filter until DPR/attendance exist). Migration `0002` applied to Neon on 2026-06-07.

## Phase 4: DPR Module — ✅ Completed (2026-06-07)

Goals:

- Build Daily Progress Report module. ✅ (site-scoped CRUD + approval)
- Support photos through signed upload URLs. ✅ (R2 presigned PUT/GET via aws4fetch; verified end-to-end via the API — browser uploads need a bucket CORS policy set in the dashboard)
- Store DPR file metadata in database. ✅ (`dpr_photos`)
- Support mobile-friendly DPR entry. ✅ (single sheet; camera capture input)
- Add DPR list, detail, create, and edit screens. ✅

Deliverables:

- DPR schema ✅ (`dpr` + `dpr_photos`, migration `0001`)
- DPR APIs ✅ (list/create/get/update/delete/approve + photo upload-url/confirm/delete)
- DPR frontend screens ✅ (list + filters, create/edit modal, detail modal with photos)
- DPR photo upload flow ✅ (presigned direct-to-R2; verified 8/8 via the API — browser PUT needs bucket CORS)
- DPR report export job ⏳ deferred to **Phase 8** (needs Cloudflare Queues)

## Phase 5: Inventory Module — ✅ Completed (2026-06-09)

Goals:

- Build material master. ✅ (`materials`, site-scoped, soft-deleted; SKU unique per site)
- Build site-wise stock tracking. ✅ (denormalized `current_stock` + immutable `stock_movements` ledger, updated in one transaction)
- Build inward, outward, transfer, and wastage flows. ✅ inward / outward / wastage / adjustment — ⏳ **transfer deferred** (cross-site; see follow-ups)
- Add low stock alerts. ✅ (`reorder_level` → `lowStock` flag + `status=low_stock` filter + live dashboard widget)
- Add inventory audit trail. ✅ (every create/update/delete + each movement audited via `writeAudit`)

Deliverables:

- Material schema ✅ (`materials`, migration `0002`)
- Stock ledger schema ✅ (`stock_movements`, append-only with `balance_after`)
- Inventory APIs ✅ (materials CRUD + movements list/create — 7 endpoints, transactional stock update, negative-stock guard)
- Inventory table screens ✅ (list + search + low-stock filter, detail modal with ledger)
- Stock movement forms ✅ (type selector + quantity/counted-stock, live "stock after" preview)
- Low stock dashboard widget ✅ (`LowStockCard`)

Note: **transfers** and **idempotency keys** for movements are deferred (transfers → cross-tenant follow-up; idempotency → Phase 9 with the middleware/service). Inventory Excel/PDF export → Phase 8 (Queues). Migration `0002` applied to Neon on 2026-06-09.

## Phase 6: Attendance And Salary — ✅ Completed (2026-06-09)

Goals:

- Build worker master. ✅ (`workers`, site-scoped, soft-deleted)
- Build attendance marking. ✅ (bulk daysheet upsert, one record per worker/day)
- Support present, absent, half-day, and overtime. ✅ (status + `overtime_hours`)
- Track advances. ✅ (`worker_advances` ledger, settled at salary time)
- Calculate salary from approved attendance. ✅ (transactional run from approved rows; rates snapshotted)
- Track salary payment status. ✅ (`unpaid`/`partial`/`paid` per payslip)

Deliverables:

- Worker schema ✅ (`workers`, migration `0003`)
- Attendance schema ✅ (`attendance` + approval gate)
- Salary schema ✅ (`salary_runs` + `salary_run_items`; advances in `worker_advances`)
- Attendance APIs ✅ (workers CRUD + bulk mark + approve + advances — 11 endpoints)
- Salary APIs ✅ (generate/list/detail/discard run + record payment — 5 endpoints)
- Attendance and salary frontend screens ✅ (Daysheet/Workers/Advances tabs; runs list + payslip detail; live "Today Attendance" dashboard widget)

Note: **idempotency keys** (salary generation/payments) and **Attendance Excel / Salary report** exports are deferred (Phase 9 and Phase 8 respectively), like the Inventory/DPR follow-ups. Migration `0003` applied to Neon on 2026-06-09; API smoke test passed 30/30 (see `docs/progress.md`).

## Phase 7: Expenses, Purchases, And Suppliers — ✅ Completed (2026-06-09)

Goals:

- Build expense tracking. ✅ (`expenses`, site-scoped, pending→approved/rejected)
- Build petty cash tracking. ✅ (`isPettyCash` flag + filter)
- Build supplier management. ✅ (`suppliers` master CRUD + outstanding balance)
- Build purchase request and purchase order flow. ✅ (single `purchases` entity: draft→ordered→partially_received→received)
- Link received goods to inventory where required. ✅ (goods receipt inwards material-linked lines into `stock_movements` in one transaction)

Deliverables:

- Expense schema ✅ (`expenses`, migration `0004`)
- Supplier schema ✅ (`suppliers`)
- Purchase schema ✅ (`purchases` + `purchase_items`)
- Expense APIs ✅ (CRUD + approve/reject — 6 endpoints)
- Purchase APIs ✅ (CRUD + receive + pay — 7 endpoints; + suppliers CRUD — 5 endpoints)
- Supplier screens ✅
- Expense and purchase screens ✅ (+ live "Today Expenses" & "Pending Payments" dashboard widgets)

Note: **expense receipt uploads** (reuse the DPR R2 flow once bucket CORS is set), **exports** (Phase 8), and **idempotency keys** for purchase creation/payments (Phase 9) are deferred. Migration `0004` applied to Neon on 2026-06-09; API smoke test passed 26/26 (see `docs/progress.md`).

## Phase 8: Reports And Background Jobs — ✅ Completed (2026-06-09)

Goals:

- Use Cloudflare Queues for PDF generation. ✅ (queue producer + consumer; `pdf-lib`)
- Use Cloudflare Queues for Excel exports. ✅ (CSV — spreadsheet-friendly; true `.xlsx` is a follow-up)
- Store generated files in R2 when needed. ✅ (`putObject`; key `exports/{siteId}/{jobId}.{ext}`)
- Add export status tracking. ✅ (`queued → processing → completed | failed`; live polling)
- Add retry handling. ✅ (`attempts` + queue `retry()` under `max_retries`; permanent failures recorded)

Deliverables:

- Report job schema ✅ (`export_jobs`, migration `0005`)
- Queue producers ✅ (`EXPORT_QUEUE` binding + `waitUntil` fallback when unbound)
- Queue consumers ✅ (`src/queue/consumer.ts`; Worker exports `{ fetch, queue }`)
- PDF reports ✅ (paginated A4-landscape tables with totals via `pdf-lib`)
- Excel exports ✅ (UTF-8 CSV with BOM; 8 report types across all modules)
- Download links ✅ (short-lived presigned R2 GET with attachment disposition)

Eight report types (`GET /reports/types`): `dpr_log`, `inventory_stock`, `stock_ledger`,
`attendance_register`, `salary_register`, `expense_register`, `purchase_register`,
`supplier_ledger` — one+ per operational module, delivering the exports deferred from
Phases 4–7. Note: prod Queues need a paid Workers plan; migration `0005` apply to Neon +
the live smoke test are pending owner authorization. See `docs/progress.md`.
